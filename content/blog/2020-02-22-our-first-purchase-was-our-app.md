## First(s)

All your business firsts are special - your first user, your first charge, your first employee. Included in that sentimental list is your first purchase for the business - the first thing you need so much as a tool to help you succeed that you pay for it.

Funnily enough for us that was us.

We were setting up a couple of endpoints using our own company account (which is a normal 'ol Formcake account under my company email) and realized that, since we'd be [launching](https://formcake.com/introducing-formcake) we needed to go beyond our simple ["Sandbox" Account](https://formcake.com/pricing) and upgrade to "Developer" to make sure we could capture all our submissions, including those using our [homepage Codepen](https://formcake.com#sandbox).

## Advantages

At first it seems silly to bill ourselves for our own service - don't we know someone with us? Like me?

But the more you think about it the more sense it makes. Billing for our own usage:

1. Let's us know if the plan limits make sense.
2. Allows us to QA our own billing infrastructure.
3. Enables us to avoid creating a "superuser" or "admin" type role to circumvent billing - everything that uses our service gets billed, period.
4. Supposedly AWS charges internal business units retail prices. If a world-destroying, everything outfit like Amazon is doing it it must be savvy!

## Conclusion

Paying for our app simultaenously validates our code and prevents us from having to (unnecessarily) write more of it.

Turns out dogfood is good for you.
