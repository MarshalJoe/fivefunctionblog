## Hi there.

We're Joe, Jon, Tyler and Dave and we built formcake, a backend form API.

## Why?

Static sites are experiencing a resurgence as stable, performant, hassle-free alternatives to a mature (or bloated) JS landscape.

But we found that as we developed static site forms for whatever reason - newsletter signups, contact us pages, small-business demo requests, etc, we kept wanting a simple endpoint to capture our form submissions - why mess up that static workflow with a server that exists just to accept an incoming "Contact Us" ping?

*(basically the part of Mailchimp's forms you actually use after stripping out all the styling nonsense)*

And thus formcake was born.

## And who are we?

Just four professional developers who built a dead-simple form tool. Feel free to read another few paragraphs on our [about](https://formcake.com/about) page.

## What does it look like though?

[Like this](https://formcake.com/docs).

## And can I try it?

[Please do](https://formcake.com/#sandbox).

## What else?

This [blog](https://formcake/com/blog) will be a resource for all web forms and - of course particularly - formcake forms. Check back for design tips, beginner tutorials, and simple step-by-step workflows for forms.
